# Cloud Architecture Planning Guide

## Budget
Questions about budget requirements.

- What is the spend allowance per month/per year?
- Is there known budget allocation restrictions? 
    > For instance, are some or all of the allocated budget only to be used for certain services or activities?
- Is there project or cost segmentation requirements? 
    > For instance, must some deployed artifacts/capabilities be deployed to separate cloud projects?
- Are there requirements for budget reporting? 
    > For instance, is there a requirement to gain visibility into individual costs per component, service or feature?
- Cost-to-Availability Tolerance Thresholds. Need to find a way to ask questions about the ROI of scaling of services to handle incremental increases (and on-demand) changes to traffic patterns. 

## Usage
Questions about: 
* system/application use expectations
* system design
* known constraints
* vendor/tool requirements
* external dependencies


- What is the expected number of users/transactions for the system? *(Might be broken down further by micro service/app)*
- What types of technologies will be used? *(Languages, Containerization, Databases, Storage, Machine Learning, Big Data, etc.)*
- Will the system be composed of commercial software (COTS) or all self-developed apps?
- Which app/services are stateless vs. stateful?
- Any known hardware/resource requirements for particular app/services?
- How many environments are needed? *(e.g. Dev, QA, Pre-Prod, Prod, etc.)*
- Any reason for not being able to use managed services?
- What managed services are needed?
- What operating systems are to be used?
- What kind of ancillary/support systems are needed? *(e.g. artifact repository management, CI/CD, user management/directory, issue tracking, etc.)*
- How/Who will manage DNS? *(Is there an existing domain?)*
- What kind of service accounts are needed for the system?
- Do Cloud resources require access to on-premise resources or visa versa? If so, what are those services and are the method of connectivity identified *(example: on-prem CI/CD pipeline needs to deploy to Cloud location and will do so over VPN or AWS DirectConnect)*
- Are there any limitations/considerations for automation tools to be used?
- Are there third-party SaaS products/vendors that need to be integrated? *(Examples: Atlassian-hosted Bitbucket code repo, LaunchDarkly feature management services, etc)*

## Availability

Questions about:
* system high availability
* system deployment


- What is the minimum level of availability required for your services? *(99.9%, 99.99%, etc.)*
- Does the system need to be geographically dispersed? What areas?
- Does the system need to run across multiple public cloud providers? Which ones *(e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc)*?
- Does data need to be available across regions? *(Replication)*
- Are there any specific requirements around load balancing? *(Geo-aware, etc.)*
- Are there any specific Disaster Recovery requirements for all or part of the system? *(Example: Loss of database services must be restored within 6 hours with no more than 12 hours loss of data.)*

## Security
Questions about security requirements.

- Do you have to comply with any particular security standard? (NIST, PCI, HIPAA, etc)
- What level of separation is required between environments (e.g. Dev, QA, etc.)? Do they need to be under different projects/accounts, VPCs, etc.?
- What are the different roles for the people accessing Cloud resources and what access do each of those roles require?
- Do you require audit logging? (If so, what needs auditing?)
- Are there any specific requirements around TLS/SSL certificate management?
- What services will be exposed externally to include connection details?(e.g. Ports, etc.)
- What are your logging requirements? (e.g. What needs to be logged and whatâ€™s the retention policy?)
- Do you require analytics/monitoring/notification on the logs collected? If so what?

## Compliance
Questions about external regulatory agency compliance. This includes government regulations and third-party certification requirements.

- Are there U.S. agency regulatory requirements? Agencies could include:  
    - FDA
    - FCC
    - FTC 
    - SEC
    - FDIC
    - DoD
    - Title IX
    - NGO - FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)

- Are there U.S laws that must be considered? Laws could include:
    - HIPAA
    - COPPA - Child Privacy Laws
    - ADA (Section 508)
    - SOX - Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
    - Dodd-Frank  - Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    - Title IX, Education Amendments of 1972
    - State-specific laws (California in particular)

- Are there third-party requirements/certifications that need to be considered?
    - Credit Card processor requirements
    - Banking requirements

- Are there non-U.S. laws or agencies that must be considered? This could include:

## Support
Questions about support scenarios.

- Who will be providing operational support for your system? Scenarios could include any of the following individually or in combination: 
    - Internal support from within the same group.
    - Internal support from another group.
    - External group contracted for this specific support scenario.
    - External group contracted for overall organization support.

- What are the required support hours?
- Are there identified support response requirements (e.g. respond within 1 hour, 6 hours or 1 business day, 3 business days, etc.)

## Other Questions
- What does the development to production process flow look like and who is going to be responsible for the different pieces?
