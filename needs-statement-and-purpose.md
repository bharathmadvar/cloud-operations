# Needs Statement and Purpose
As our business continues to grow and our industry changes, OCI needs to adapt & diversify our services accordingly to meet our client’s technological demands. In the past OCI experienced lost opportunities for future program development because OCI does not offer 24/365 operations support for new cloud programs developed by us. 

The purpose of our Cloud Operations Initiative will be to provide customers with 24/365 operations support for OCI developed systems. OCI’s Cloud operations will emphasize on encompassing the processes of managing and delivering cloud services and infrastructure to either an internal or an external user base. Our Cloud Operations Initiative will provide those customers with system operations support which will include monitoring, alerting, upgrading and recovery of the system in case of a failure. This living document will help define the right operational procedures and practices for hosting software solutions with cloud services rather than morph traditional approaches to operations for the cloud.

By formalizing best practices and procedures that allow cloud-based platforms, applications and data to live on cloud platforms and function well over a long duration of time we can offer a service that allows us to solve problems in real time without negatively impacting our customers.  We also must be always cognizance that the success of our cloud computing won’t be defined around our ability to get workloads in the cloud but will be the ability to solve real business problems over time for our clients. 
## Scope
This initiative will involve ensuring peak performance and maintaining availability in order to satisfy the needs and expectations of customers and meet service level agreement standards. This will also include ensuring security and compliance, as well as keeping tabs on all operational costs.
### Why CloudOps Now at OCI?
The real question is: `How does cloud change things?`  Or, `what does cloud computing at OCI bring to the table that makes operations different to our customers?`  Consider the following:
- **The ability to scale** out or expand capacity at any time.  Clouds provide the ability to self- or auto-provision servers.  This feature adds a great deal of value but can be a challenge to manage.
- **The distributed and stateless** nature of cloud-based platforms means that operations must adjust to management that could span across the world.
- **Infrastructure agnostic:** Clouds can abstract the underlying infrastructure from the platforms and applications. 
- **Location transparent:** We don’t really care where the physical servers exist, and we must manage them the same way.
- **Latency tolerant:** Latency can vary a great deal, and you’ll need to operate and manage clouds using the same attributes.
- **Loosely coupled:** Clouds run applications that share common services and are not bound together. 
- **Leveraging data that is shared, replicated, and distributed** means that data is not centrally located, and is either physically or logically separated.
- **Automated:** Much of the operations for clouds leverage a great deal of automation. 
- **Self-healing:** Cloud uses automation as a way to fix common operational problems without effecting the applications or users.
- **Dual active** (or active/active) refers to how the cloud uses a network of independent processing nodes, where each node has access to a replicated database to give each node access and usage of a single application.
- Finally, **metered cost**, or usage-based accounting, bills the cloud account to the requesting resource or user for cloud usage.
